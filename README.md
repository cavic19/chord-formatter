# Chord formatter

Ideally a frontend library (TS) that parses a encoded chords/lyrics and renders into html? Probably using the pre tag, or just spaces. 

I want the codec to include blocks like verse, chorus, solo, into, etc. I wanto ti include chords, whcih can be transposable. 

The code could look like smthing like 
```
Zatim co se [Ami] koupes
```
